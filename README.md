The program is a number guessing game. It picks a (pseudo) random number between 1 and 100 and asks the player to guess it. The player is given five tries. If the player fails to guess the program number within five tries, the program tells them that they have lost and quits. If the player guesses the same incorrect number twice, the program reminds the player to guess novel numbers. After each guess, the program tells the player if their guess was higher or lower than the program's number. If the player guesses correctly, the program informs them that they win and quits.

The program code includes two methods. The first generates the random program number. The second method encapsulates the conditional code.

The game runs from the command line and can be initiated by typing "ruby guessing_game.rb".
